title:  "A Post for More Posts"

Let's be honest, I am a lazy guy. But I still want to improve myself. After suffering lots problems for my writting skills. I am thinking about writing posts. This just for practice.

The idea is thinking about a posts list so that I don't have to spend time thinking about what should I do next.

Here is a list:

* vscode is amazing
* book recommendation -- soft skills
* mysql -- understand sysvar
* how to read big open source project code
